Increase sales by adding augmented reality to your Matterport scan
Expand your existing offering with indoor navigation and other powerful features – upgrade any existing or upcoming Matterport scan of your client with augmented reality
Matterport provides all features to offer your clients an immersive experience online, but that’s not all. INDOAR oder SERVICE AR takes it a step further. With just a few simple steps you can unleash the full potential of your digital twin and create augmented reality experiences on-site.
What does this mean? Instead of just walking through a virtual environment on your screen, you can actually navigate through the physical location using a mobile device. Additionally, you can display digital content like text, video, 3D objects etc. during a tour.

4. Test and publish your project
