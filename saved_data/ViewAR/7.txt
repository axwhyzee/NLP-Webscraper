Innovative technology that future-proofs libraries
Integrate modern technology into day-to-day business of libraries to stay relevant.
The fear of becoming outdated
In the current age of digital transformation, efficient finding of information has become more important than ever. Libraries are having a hard time catching up with this evolution. They will have to adjust their tactics in order to stay relevant and not become obsolete in the near future. For library visitors, finding a book or the right shelves can sometimes be tedious. This can be very demotivating in an age when everything can be done with a single click.
Motivate readers to visit libraries again
With all the exciting inventions already available online, getting new patrons is becoming harder, but not impossible. By creating exciting experiences for visitors with cutting edge technology like augmented reality, you can increase their motivation to visit libraries more frequently. With digital content, borrowing a book can be a fascinating experience. Libraries cannot compete with the efficiency of high-speed-internet that offers almost every book with just the click of a button. But with indoor navigation, libraries can make the finding of books more exciting – creating an additional reason for Gen-Z to visit them. This way, libraries can evolve from antiquarian and soon-to-be-obsolete institutions to a futuristic universe of information.
With INDOAR, innovation becomes part of your library, creating a more engaging experience for borrowers and visitors alike – making sure patrons stay fascinated by your library for years to come.
