Innovative technology that helps to revive the retail industry
Increase sales and enrich the shopping experience with smartphone based technologies.
The fight against online
The recent pandemic had a significant impact on the shopping-industry and the overall consumer behavior has radically shifted. More than ever, consumers are looking for convenience and an experience when shopping the latest trends, which is why online shopping has increased drastically. During lockdown many consumers have adjusted to the more convenient online stores. They also found new online shops and changed their buying habits. This is a drastic change in customer behavior and store-owners will need to adapt if they do not want to get left behind. Retail has lost its edge for more convenient solutions. What if shopping malls and individual stores can get customers back with new innovative technologies that make shopping more exciting and convenient too? Many shops have closed already and the ones who are still open are trying out different marketing efforts to bring the customers back into their physical store.
Bringing customers back to stores
Through new technologies, you can entice your customers to come back to your store. This offers your customers a whole new way to shop. Sell more by making the shopping experience as convenient as possible for the consumer. Augmented reality for retail and shopping malls opens up new ways to add value to the shopping experience, increase marketing awareness and even sales revenue. It is also possible to address the shoppers directly, as in an online interface, and give them offers that are personalized for them. This will not only increase the experience for shoppers, but will also generate more revenue.
Our solutions provide retailers with tools to easily create a virtual shopping experience connected to their already existing online-shop. Enhance the retail experience with augmented reality information, guiding, advertising and reporting. This enables retailers to create a consistent brand experience across locations and gives visitors high-quality access to products in a safe and exciting new way.
